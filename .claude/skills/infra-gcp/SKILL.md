# infra-gcp — Google Cloud, with the identity model that removes the keys

**Pinned:** gcloud, google-cloud-* — unpinned · authored 2026-07 · run `/skill-update infra-gcp` once
the SDK is installed (`gcloud version`). GCP renames and reorganises services regularly — verify
service names against current docs before relying on them.

> On-demand: load this when the project runs on GCP. **The boundary is the IAM binding, not this
> skill's judgment** — same model as the rest of the repo (hooks are guardrails; permissions are the
> boundary), extended to this cloud. Canon: `identity-and-access.md` (`I1`–`I3`),
> `platform-security.md` (`P8`, `P11`), `supply-chain.md` (`C6`). Declaring any of this belongs in
> `iac-terraform`; workloads on the cluster are `kubernetes`.

## Coming from AWS

| AWS | GCP | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Account | **Project** | The main isolation unit. Projects are cheap — use them per environment |
| Organizations / OU | Organization / **Folder** | IAM inherits *down* the hierarchy |
| IAM role + policy | **Role** bound to a principal on a resource | No trust policy; the binding *is* the grant |
| IRSA | **Workload Identity Federation** | Same idea, less setup |
| S3 | Cloud Storage (GCS) | |
| EKS | **GKE** | Autopilot has no AWS equivalent |
| Lambda | Cloud Functions / **Cloud Run** | Cloud Run takes a container; usually the better fit |
| Fargate | Cloud Run | |
| RDS / Aurora | Cloud SQL / **AlloyDB** | Spanner for global horizontal scale |
| DynamoDB | Firestore / Bigtable | |
| Redshift | **BigQuery** | Serverless; no cluster to size |
| CodeBuild / CodePipeline | **Cloud Build** | |
| ECR | **Artifact Registry** | |
| Secrets Manager | **Secret Manager** | |
| Bedrock | **Vertex AI** | |
| CloudTrail | **Cloud Audit Logs** | Admin Activity on by default; **Data Access is not** |

## 1. Identity and least privilege

GCP's model is *bindings*: a **role** (a set of permissions) is bound to a **principal** on a
**resource**. There is no trust policy to get wrong — but there is inheritance, and that is where
over-permission comes from.

- **Grant at the narrowest resource, never the project by default.** A role bound at the *project*
  applies to every resource in it, and a role at the *folder* applies to every project beneath. This
  is the most common way GCP permissions become far broader than intended.
- **Avoid the basic roles** — `roles/owner`, `roles/editor`, `roles/viewer`. `Editor` in particular
  is enormous and is what a default service account gets.
- **Predefined roles over custom** where one fits; custom roles when you need a genuinely narrow set,
  accepting the maintenance.
- **Disable the default service accounts' automatic grants.** Compute Engine's default SA gets
  `Editor` unless an org policy stops it — set
  `constraints/iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts` to prevent it.
- **Org policy constraints are the guardrails worth setting on day one:**
  `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` (see below), `compute.requireShieldedVm`,
  `storage.publicAccessPrevention`, `sql.restrictPublicIp`.
- Use `gcloud policy-intelligence` / the IAM Recommender to find and remove unused permissions —
  it works from actual usage.

**Service account keys should not exist** (`I3`). A downloaded `key.json` is a long-lived credential
that will end up in a repo, an image, or a laptop. Turn key creation off org-wide with
`constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` and use the alternatives:

```bash
# Which identity am I? (the GCP equivalent of `aws sts get-caller-identity` — S8)
gcloud auth list
gcloud config get-value project

# GKE Workload Identity — the pod's KSA acts as a Google SA. No key anywhere.
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER --workload-pool=PROJECT.svc.id.goog
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding GSA@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member "serviceAccount:PROJECT.svc.id.goog[NAMESPACE/KSA]"
kubectl annotate serviceaccount KSA -n NAMESPACE \
  iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=GSA@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**CI → GCP is Workload Identity Federation, not a key** (`C6`). Scope the attribute condition to the
repository **and the ref**; a pool that trusts `repository == "org/repo"` alone accepts any branch,
including one a contributor pushed.

## 2. GKE

- **Autopilot** manages nodes for you and enforces a hardened baseline — a good default when you
  don't need node-level control. **Standard** when you need custom node pools, specific GPU
  configurations, or DaemonSets Autopilot restricts.
- **Workload Identity on, always** (above). It is the reason to prefer GKE's identity story.
- **Private cluster** with authorized networks for the control plane; nodes without public IPs.
- **Shielded GKE nodes** and Container-Optimized OS.
- **GPU node pools** need a taint so ordinary workloads don't land on them, plus the driver
  DaemonSet. Node auto-provisioning is convenient and can be expensive — bound it.
- What Google owns vs you: record it in `memory/process/control-coverage.md` rather than assuming
  (`P8`). Autopilot moves more of the CIS Kubernetes §1–4 surface to Google than Standard does.

## 3. Serverless

**Cloud Run** is usually the right serverless answer for an AI platform: it takes a container, so it
runs the same image as everywhere else, and it scales to zero.

- **Cold start against an LLM latency SLO** (`reliability-sre` `R1`): set `--min-instances` above
  zero for anything user-facing. Loading model weights on cold start is minutes, not milliseconds.
- **Request timeout maxes out at 60 minutes**; a long generation still needs a job or a queue
  (`caching-and-queues`) rather than a synchronous request.
- **One dedicated service account per service**, with only the roles that service needs — not the
  default compute SA.
- **`--no-allow-unauthenticated` by default**; put IAM or an API gateway in front.
- **Cloud Run jobs** for batch work; **Cloud Functions** for small event handlers, though Cloud Run
  covers most of it now.

## 4. Managed databases

| Service | For |
|---|---|
| **Cloud SQL** (Postgres/MySQL) | Default OLTP. Supports `pgvector` — see `vector-stores` |
| **AlloyDB** | Postgres-compatible, higher performance, better analytics |
| **Spanner** | Global, horizontally scalable, strongly consistent. Real cost |
| **Firestore / Bigtable** | Document / wide-column |
| **BigQuery** | Analytics warehouse. Serverless — see `sql` |

Non-negotiables (`P11`, `D9`): **private IP only** — enforce with the `sql.restrictPublicIp` org
policy so it cannot be turned on by accident; connect via the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or a private
service connection; **IAM database authentication** rather than stored passwords where supported;
CMEK where the data class warrants it; automated backups with **a tested restore** (`D10`).

BigQuery note: it is billed by bytes scanned. Partition and cluster tables, and set custom quotas —
`SELECT *` on a large table is a budget event, and it is exactly what an agent writes by default.

## 5. Cloud-native CI/CD

**Cloud Build** + **Artifact Registry**, held to the same bar as `secure-cicd`:

- The build service account is **least-privilege and per-pipeline** — not the default, which is
  broad.
- **No long-lived credentials in builds**; Cloud Build has an identity, use it.
- **Untrusted-contributor builds get no secrets** — the PPE rule (`CICD-SEC-4`) applies here exactly
  as on GitHub Actions.
- **Artifact Registry** with vulnerability scanning on, immutable tags, and **Binary Authorization**
  to require attestations before GKE will run an image — this is the GCP mechanism for
  `supply-chain.md` `C3` (verify what you run), and it is the one worth wiring.

## 6. Vertex AI

- **Data handling terms** — what is retained, for how long, and where. Sending a prompt to a hosted
  model is egress and therefore publishing (`security.md` `S7`); confirm the terms for the specific
  service and region rather than assuming, and record the answer.
- **Pin the model version**, not a floating alias (`model-governance.md` `M14`). A silently updated
  model invalidates every evaluation you have.
- **Regional endpoints** for data residency; check that every component of the request path stays in
  region.
- Vertex AI Pipelines exists; if you already run an orchestrator, see `workflow-orchestration` before
  adding a second one.

## Gotchas

- **A role granted at the project level "just to unblock it."** It inherits to everything and nobody
  narrows it later.
- **A service account key in a repo.** Turn off key creation org-wide; it is the single highest-value
  control on this list.
- **Data Access audit logs are off by default.** Admin Activity is on; "who read this bucket" is not
  recorded unless you enable it (`P9`) — and you cannot enable it retroactively.
- **Cloud Run scaling to zero on a latency-sensitive path.** Cold start plus model load is a
  user-visible outage that looks like slowness.
- **Public Cloud SQL IP.** Use the org policy so it cannot be enabled by accident (`P11`).
- **BigQuery cost from an unbounded query.** Set custom quotas before the bill.
- **Project sprawl with no folder structure**, so IAM cannot be reasoned about at all.
